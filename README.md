# Pasta

Pasta is a minimal Pastebin on Cloudflare.

It is a toy project I wrote to get experience with Cloudflare Workers and writing WebAssembly apps with Rust.

Static assets (`/public`) can be served from GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages.
Pastes are created with Cloudflare Workers and stored in Cloudflare Workers KV.

You can see a running instance at [pasta.zpfeiffer.com](pasta.zpfeiffer.com).
